# Learning to Learn

## Modes of thinking

* Focused mode

    This mode triggers only a pre-set natural path ways while learning something.
    All neurons and closely knitted, hence the signals may not reach other parts of brain circuitry.

* Diffused mode

    This mode invokes unreachable neural path ways and providing better perspective, 
    understanding and also for retention by improved connectivity.

    Neurons (connecting pathways) are little relaxed and less dense, hence new connections
    will happen and reach other parts of brain’s network.

    Walking, shower etc. helps.


## Sleep

* Sleep cleans toxic wastes in brain
* Think about an idea and wish to dream about it. The
    dream phase definitely re-covers the entire materials. Helps in retention.

* Helps in diffused mode thinking.


## Memory

* Long term memory - warehouse
* Working set memory
    A very limited set of 4 ideas can exist at a time. To push
    a newly acquired idea to long term..do repeated thinking, analysis, etc.
* Spaced learning helps in making the learning concrete.
    Re-visit the topics of interest at frequent intervals to cement the ideas better.

## Brian biology

* New neurons form during exercising !.

## Effective learning and being creative

* Explanatory questions - how to explain to 10 yr old ?
* Recall - main ideas of the last read page, before the next
* Chunking - repeat and practice so that, that idea/solution becomes a single entity.
* Spaced repetition
* Use metaphors and analogies.
* Frequent testing..
* Be with people who are enthused about learning new

## Procastination.

* Use Promodoro technique.

## Chunking

* Focus - new neural connections
* Understand the idea
* Practice
* Do it yourself
* Context - multiple chunks
* Bottom up learning - practice and chunking
    * how to use a technique
* Top down learning - Big picture
    * when to use a technique

* When both the forms of learning happens
    a context builds up

## Illusions of competence

* It feels easy to solve, once you have seen the solution.
* Recall - helps in deep learning, build chunks

## Overlearning, Blocking, Interleaving

* Overlearing a known subset and avoid difficult builds an illusion of competence. Avoid it.
* Blocking: sometimes an intution or a already known similar problem will block the new learning to happen
* Interleaving muliple subjects helps in reuse/strengthen ideas from other topics.

*  Chunk is piece of information, technique and can be used.
* A set of meaningfully connected smller-ideas, looking like a single unit of thought.
* Compacted set of ideas
* Occupies only one slot
* Develop a chunk by
    * Focussed attention
    * Basic Understanding
    * Practice
    * Recall - neuro hooks
    * Recall in environments
    * Transfer - chunk in one area helping in other areas
    * Interleaving 
    * Test yourself - to avoid Illusion of competence
    * Mistakes are good 
    * Use deliberate practice in difficult areas

## Learning..

* Any change causes Discomfort
OCEAN
openess - creative achievement
agreeable - more disagreeable - higher creative
conscious
extroversion
neurotism

most effective learning
* visual/verbal learning
* zooming in and out - bigger picture, detailed

Amy Alkon

* Focused on writing
* Procastination
* Put that time
* Key points in book

## Procrastination and memory

### Habits - to save energy

Habits are display of neurological pathways set.

1. The Cue - to become a zombie
1. The routine - the habitual response mode
1. The reward - immediate feeling of pleasure
    - finding ways to reward
1. The belief - 


To change a habit..change parts of it.

Tools to reframe things
Focusing on ‘Process’ instead of ‘Product’
Product triggers the pain.
Process - small chunks of work.

Zombies find it easy to follow Process

### Harnessing your zombies to help you.

Change the Reaction to the cue
The Cue: to procastination mode
    * location
    * time
    * how you feel
    * reactions

The routine:
    * move to less painful
    * plan - practical 
    * pomodoro technique

The reward:
    * sense of satisfaction
    * make the reward so that..brain starts wanting it.

The belief:
    * believe that it is possible
    * develop with new community

### Juggling life and learning

* Weekly list of key tasks
* Daily ‘to do’ list - before you go to sleep
* The zombie likes them
* Plan your quitting time.

## How to become better learner

* Physical exercises - new neuron survive
* Practice - when prepared
* Learning, Planning, Language - Humans

## Unlocking potential
