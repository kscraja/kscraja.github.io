# Learning to Learn

## Modes of thinking

* Focused mode

    This mode triggers only a pre-set natural path ways while learning something.
    All neurons and closely knitted, hence the signals may not reach other parts of brain circuitry.

* Diffused mode

    This mode invokes unreachable neural path ways and providing better perspective, 
    understanding and also for retention by improved connectivity.

    Neurons (connecting pathways) are little relaxed and less dense, hence new connections
    will happen and reach other parts of brainâ€™s network.

    Walking, shower etc. helps.


## Sleep

* Sleep cleans toxic wastes in brain
* Think about an idea and wish to dream about it. The
    dream phase definitely re-covers the entire materials. Helps in retention.

* Helps in diffused mode thinking.


## Memory

* Long term memory - warehouse
* Working set memory
    A very limited set of 4 ideas can exist at a time. To push
    a newly acquired idea to long term..do repeated thinking, analysis, etc.
* Spaced learning helps in making the learning concrete.
    Re-visit the topics of interest at frequent intervals to cement the ideas better.

## Brian biology

* New neurons form during exercising !.

## Effective learning and being creative

* Explanatory questions - how to explain to 10 yr old ?
* Recall - main ideas of the last read page, before the next
* Chunking - repeat and practice so that, that idea/solution becomes a single entity.
* Spaced repetition
* Use metaphors and analogies.
* Frequent testing..
* Be with people who are enthused about learning new

## Procastination.

* Use Promodoro technique.

## Chunking

* Focus - new neural connections
* Understand the idea
* Practice
* Do it yourself
* Context - multiple chunks
* Bottom up learning - practice and chunking
    * how to use a technique
* Top down learning - Big picture
    * when to use a technique

* When both the forms of learning happens
    a context builds up

## Illusions of competence

* Recall - helps in deep learning, build chunks
