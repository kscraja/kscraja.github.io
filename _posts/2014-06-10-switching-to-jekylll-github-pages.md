## Why ?

Somehow, writing on wordpress felt like difficult, distant, not-now kind of activity.
Hence, whenever the, the itch to write triggers, I postpone it citing them.
I was looking for something with

* always with me
    - on my laptop
* feel like owning it
    - github
* write whenever (quick turnaround)
    - vim editor
    - no browser (browser..feels like little away)
* good control over styling
    - markdown

Jekyll and Github pages combination seems to have given the solution that is the closest.
The github gave me a comfort that my assets(code,docs etc) are always with me.
The jekyll has both the local service to finetune the style and structure and github pages to host and publish

## How to ..

#### Setup Jekyll

<http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/>

#### Setup github and github-pages account

<https://pages.github.com/>

github pages are commited to repository: *‘\<username\>.github.io’*

The pages will be made available at *http://\<username\>.github.io*

*It will take 10 minutes after your first push and view*

## Other things..

The way the vanilla version looks is not upto my liking.
But given the other offerings, I am willing to learn jekyll systems to prime it later.
