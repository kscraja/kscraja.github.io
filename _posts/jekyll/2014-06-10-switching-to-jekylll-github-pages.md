## Why ?

Somehow, writing on wordpress felt like difficult, distant, not-now kind of activity.
Hence, whenever the itch to write triggers, I postpone it citing those reasons.

I was looking for something that ...

* is always with me
    - on my laptop
* feels like owning it
    - github
* makes me write (quick turnaround)
    - vim editor
    - no browser (browser..feels like little away)
* has good control over styling
    - markdown

Jekyll and Github pages combination seems to have given the solution that is the closest.
The github gave me a comfort that my assets(code,docs etc) are always with me.
The jekyll has both the local service to finetune the style and structure and github pages to host and publish

## How to ..

#### Setup Jekyll

<http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/home/>

#### Setup github and github-pages account

<https://pages.github.com/>

github pages are commited to repository: `<username>.github.io`

The pages will be made available at `http://<username>.github.io`

*It will take 10 minutes after your first push to view pages*

## Other things..

The way the vanilla version looks is not upto my liking.
But given the other offerings, I am willing to learn jekyll systems to prime it later.

## Now..

* I just open vim and write into a markdown file.
* When it has acquired some meat..
    * start jekyll `jekyll serve --watch`
    * hit <http://localhost:4000>
* Fine tune the text, style etc
* Commit and push it to github 
* Done..it is available to world !!
