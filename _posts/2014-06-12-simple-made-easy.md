title: Simple Made Easy - my understanding
categories: tech talks
--- 

## Simple
* only one
* one idea/concept
* one thread of idea - no interleaving
* objective

## Easy

* nearness, immediately available
* toolkits, experience, languages
* subjective
* near to our understanding, 

## Construct Vs Artifact

* experience of use of construct 
* constructs are pieces
* artifact is final output

* definition of artifact: "Something viewed as a product of human conception or agency rather than an inherent element”

* focusing more on the construct - easy to type, programmer convinience
* artifact - correctness, quality, maintenance

* focusing more on constructs rather than on artifact

* We must assess constructs by their artifacts.

## Limits

* only good understanding -> reliable products/work
* only few things at a time
* interwined things must be considered together
* complexity weakens(undermine) the understanding


## Change

* Agile and XP - BAD !
* requires analysis and decisions
* ability to reason about the program - changing without fear

## Debugging

* passed the type checker
* passed the tests
* its like driving by hitting guard rails
* reasoning is important

## Development Speed

* ease gives - early speed
* ignorning complexity will slow you down over the long haul

## Easy yet complex

* complicating constructs are 
    * easily described
    * familiar
    * available
    * easy to use

* What matters is the complexity they yield
    * any such complexity is incidental
* 
## Benefits of simplicity

* Ease of understanding
* Ease of change
* Easier debugging
* Flexibility
    * policy
    * location etc

## Making things Easy

* make things near(easy) by simplifying 

## Toolkit

#### Complexity
* State, Objects
* Methods
* vars
* Inheritance, switch, pattern match
* Syntax
* Imperative loops, fold
* Actors
* ORM
* Conditionals
* Inconsistency

#### Simplicity
* Values
* Functions, Namespaces
* Managed refs
* Polymorphism a la carte 
* Data
* Set functions
* Queues
* Declarative data manipulation
* Rules
* Consistency

## Compose

## Complect - Complexity

## Modulariy and Simplicity

## State is Never Simple
* it is easy
* complects value and time

## Not all refs/vars are Equal

* None make state simple
* Clojure and Haskell refs compose value and time
    * Allow you to extract a simple value
    * Provide abstractions of time

## The complecity tool kit

* State
    * Everything that touches it
* Objects
    * State, Identity, value

* Methods
    * Function and state, namespaces

* Syntax
    * Meaning, order

* Inheritance
    * Types

* Switch/matching
    * Multiple who/what pairs

* variables
    * Value, time

* imperative loops,fold
    * what/how

* Actors
    * what/who

* ORM
    * OMG

* Conditionals
    * Why, rest of program

## The simplicity toolkit

* Values
    * final, persisten collections

* Functions
    * a.k.a stateless methods

* Namespaces
    * language support

* Data
    * maps, sets, arrays, xml, json etc

* Polymorphism
    * clojure protocols, type classes

* Set functions
    * libraries

* Queues
    * libraries

* Declarative data manipulation
    * SQL/LINQ/Datalog

* Rules
    * Libraries, prolog

* Consistency
    * Transactions, values

## Abstraction for Simplicity

* Abstract
    * drawn away

* vs Abstraction as complexity hiding


## What

* Operations

* Form abstractions from related sets of functions
    * small sets

* Don’t complect with: How
* 


## Use data as data

* Don’t wrap it up in a class etc.

## Simplicity is a Choice

* Requires vigilance, sensibilities and care
* relating simplicity with ease is wrong!
* simlicity is only one thing - NO entanglement
* relying on testing, refactoring, type systems - are peripheral to producing good software

## Simplicity Made Easy

* Choose simple constructs over complexity-generating constructs
    * `It is the artifacts not the authoring`

* creating abstracts with simplicity as a basis
* simplify the problem space before you start
* simplicity often means making more things, not fewer
