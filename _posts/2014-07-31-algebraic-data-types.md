## Beautiful post
* <http://tech.esper.com/2014/07/30/algebraic-data-types/>


## Products

* structs in C
* class in Java
* records in scheme/lisp
* Constructors in Haskell

## Variants

* Either, Maybe, Option - Scala/Haskell
* Deconstruction using pattern match
* tagged union in C
* instanceof in java

## Power of the ADT
* The definition of ADT is close to problem domain.
* The structure of solution using ADT has
    the same structure as definition itself.
* Good for defining expressions, trees, parsers etc.
