Is there a way/plugin which blocks certain kinds of people :

For e.g: lets say..I want to…hmm…should I say it…..hmmm….to hell with it.

Lets say, I want to block My Wife from reading an article.

It should block not only my wife. As it doesn’t help, It should block all the friends of my wife..who might read it and gossip about it.

If there is none..I see $$$$$….But please confirm..
