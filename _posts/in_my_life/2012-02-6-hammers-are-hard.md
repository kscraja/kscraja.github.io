title: Hammers are hard.

Once me and a friend(SG), who also happens to professor in our university, were on our way to meet another friend.

We had to stop to buy some goodies. It so happens that my car’s auto-lock system gone into a crazy state and wasn’t yielding to our curses.

Everybody is waiting, its getting dark and no help around. It occurred  that we can squeeze through the dicky and drive to nearest service center.

Few things for better perspective.

Our car was stuck on a busy road which makes everybody to have good look at what we were doing.

I was in a formal attire (though rarely..but on that day). My friend was even better. He was wearing a suit/tie/polished-shoes etc..etc. I am on heavier side (96kg). But urgency of the situation demanded any delay will worsen situation. I got into do-the-job mode and began implementing the plan.

I opened the dicky (using the key), folded the back seat..got into navigator’s seat and then finally into the driver’s seat. Wow..what an experience. Even after so many days I can still feel the thrill, executing the impossible (for me). I was totally wet due to sweat but the achievement was very sweet.

Next comes my super-formal friend. I started the engine, lowered the side window and he tried to hop in to the seat next to the driver. Sitting inside and watching this guy trying to hop in was so funny. I can imagine how funny it was for others watching us. So embarrassing..but funny.

Finally, it was so relieving to escape from all the inquisitive stares.

We reached the service station, they were almost closing. So we found a very young lad, kind of helper, and explained whole situation about my car not getting unlocked via a car-remote. We explained everything sitting inside the car, as we were in no position to get out.

He listened very attentively, took the car key, placed in the key-slot near the door handle and opened it. He SMILED!!!.. It looked like a smile to us..but, I guess, what he intended was very different.

We were silent for few minutes. We couldn’t dare to look into each others eyes.

At that moment..it dawned upon me that..

We (at-least myself) humans have immense capacity to be IDIOTS.

Hmm.. about the title “Hammers are hard”   ???

Oh..simple..are you expecting me prove that hammers are hard??

Cm’on…that is exactly what I was writing about so far… We have immense capacity to be  …..
