I am feeling nostalgic about school/home-town/language and other things where one feels at ‘home’.

I lived almost 16(12 + 4) years of my life away from my home-town/language/people. I decided that I will go back and resume my life.

In this context, I was looking for a suitable job. Naturally, I needed a resume for a start.

For the first time I had to draft my resume. Last time I did was way back in college days when it was just filling a resume-template.

I kept postponing thinking that some opportunity will come my way. Basically that is how things have worked out for me. Initially it was ‘entrepreneur’ spirit that kept me busy with my company(10 years) then 3 years of free lancing and academic endeavor mixed with spirit to travel and meet other cultures of my country.

This time the wind started blowing towards my home town and people. I said let’s go. But the big hitch is my resume for finding a job.

Resume writing is not my strong skill as it involves displaying your-self in a way that catches the eye. I felt like ‘late night seller’ that stands around the corner.

Initially, my resume was just 1 page just stating my academic and professional interests. I waited for almost 10 days for something to happen but nothing…not even…’are you there?’.

My brother jumped in and delivered the sermon of ‘resume-writing’ and how the corporate recruitment system works and how to embellish the resume for catching the eye.

Though reluctantly, I started.

I decided to furnish only the truth, even if it means a small resume with the prospect of not having a job.

It took almost 6 hours to think through 12 years of work experience and note down what happened and when.

Finally, when I looked on the ‘skill set’ that I accumulated over these hard worked years, I felt good about myself. It was really long list. I never knew that I know so much about computers/languages/libraries/tools etc. The resume felt true and reflected right about me.

Now another doubt started pestering me. With so much of false make-up that happens in some cases of resume preparation, I was thinking about how my resume will be considered. By any chance would it also be considered as one and be tagged ‘false’. But then I am ok with taking chances as it suits my nature of being on the edge.

Keeping my fingers crossed.

After having done a good work, I am little buoyant. Now I know why girls spend so much time about their wardrobes and makeup kits. It is nice little feeling that one gets about one-self. Being a ‘boy’, I am making easy  guesses.. no offense meant.

After all.. resume writing is not that difficult at all, if one wants to write just the truth.

Yes, it is really that simple !!.
