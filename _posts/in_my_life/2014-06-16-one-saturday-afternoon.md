During my college days as faculty, I found a very curious T-shirt worn by ...

Being Saturday, you will find latest fashion, walking and talking.

Its a plain colored T-Shirt with nothing written on, except letters ‘C’ and ‘L’ on right and left arms respectively.

It took me a while…. but got it.

I salute the creative capacity of the people.
