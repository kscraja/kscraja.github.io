I was in a provisional store looking for a dry fruit named ‘ajmer’. I asked the grand-fatherly-old man attending the store about its availability and price. He gave a very old-odd stare at me and said “in my whole life of selling provisions I never came across ‘ajmer’”. I felt very odd since my brother told me that the fruit is good for health and must be eaten regularly.

After few uncomfortable moments, I called my reference man, Naren. I put a different question to him.
Where can I find ‘ajmer’ ?.

Promptly came back the reply “in almost every provisional store”. Few millionth’s moments of “being correct” flew by.
Immediately, he added, “but you should ask for ‘anjeer’ not ‘ajmer’.

What’s in the name?…EVERYTHING!.

By the way, I was really surprised the way Naren understood my situation and answered it so nicely and correctly without any explanation from my side. Friends are always there.
