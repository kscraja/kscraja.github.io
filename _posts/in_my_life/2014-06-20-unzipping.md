 I am a programmer and I am ok with computers.

 Its winter here in dehradun..rather ver cold winter for me. The effect of the winter..I realized..but in an unique way…

 How numb we come both mentally and physically…here it goes..

 I was wearing a winter jacket the other day. An above waist jacket.

 Naturally..nature calls are quite often during winter. I rushed to the rest room.

 I unzipped the jacket and was standing there and thinking ..why i am not feeling relieved..

 Few seconds ..then it occurred to me why..
