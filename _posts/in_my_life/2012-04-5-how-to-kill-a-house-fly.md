Old is gold. Yes..everybody knows that.

‘Art of war’ book says:

When weak, make the opponent believe that you are strong.

When strong, make the opponent believe that you are weak.

Surprise attack yields highest returns.

I tried to use the above philosophy in my attempt to get rid of a fly that was pestering me for some time.

I poured out last few drops of tea that was left in my cup, I was waiting for good number of them to settle (I am strong hence tried to appear weak).

When the time was just right for my ‘surprise attack’, I tried to squash them all with one nice full palm, full speed hit on the table.

Very satisfying sound, but totally unexpected results. Because of hard hit, small-small tea droplets scattered are all over the table and laptop screen and keyboard.

Worst part, not even a single fly died in my well designed, theoretically strong attack plan and its execution.

I conceded defeat and started cleaning the table.

The question still remains: ‘How to kill a house fly’.

The old is not really that gold.
