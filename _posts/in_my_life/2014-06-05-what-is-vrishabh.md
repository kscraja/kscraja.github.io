title: What is vrishabh ?
---

My 8 eight year old daughter came and asked me..hmm..

“Vrishab” is a hindi (asia/india) word meaning ox or a bull

Wow..such a simple question.

I teach in an university for my daily bread. Hence the expression.

I put on my “teacher” hat and started to convey the idea.

She knows what a ‘cow’ means. Hence I thought it will be a cake walk.

So I told her there are two colors in ‘cow’ segment. One is black and other is white.
She happily understood since she has seen the ‘black’ one which is a buffalo.

I continued.. Just like boys and girls, there are girls and boys in ‘cow’ segment’. She smiled.

Now the trick comes..

I told her… a boy cow is called ‘VRISHABH’. Good..She understood.

Next, its time for testing..I am a teacher.. I can’t help it.

I kept asking silly non related questions…and in between them I popped this question once again “What is VRISHABH”.

The answer came promptly: “cowboy”

Even today, I can hear my heart gradually cracking and my wife’s laughs
