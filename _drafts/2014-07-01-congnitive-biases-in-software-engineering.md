## Why reposting or rewriting ??

Just for longer retention.

## Fundamental Attribution Erroro

    It describes the tendency to overestimate the effect of dispostion
    or personality and underestimate the effect of the situation.

    This aspect is reflected in bug blame. When it’s other’s bug, it is stupidity.
    When it is ours, it is due to situation/deadlines/improper spec etc.

## Confirmation Bias

    Tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs.

    Reflects in testing. Always testing only happy-paths. It is very poking to follow
    different paths to test the code that is written by self.

## Bandwagon Effect
    
    If some big-shot agrees to some idea, rest of the group just follows, 
    even when they were differing initially.

    Reflected in design decisions, estimates etc.

## Hyperbolic Discounting

    We prefer the one that arrives sooner rather than later.
    Even when the later thing is more correct/advantageous.

    Reflected in quick hacks, design shortcuts for quickly
    pushing the code off the desk.

## Negative Bias
    
    We are all hardwired to listen to people who say NO!. And worse,
    the same people become respectable !.
