## Points

* They have to like you.
* They have to think that you deserve an offer
* They should feel that you can be employed (not highly in demand..hence might fly away)
* Don’t negotiate for negotiation sake
* Learn more about the company, role, work
* Prioritize 
    * salary
    * perks
    * work place
    * role
    * kind of work
    * city
* Discuss all pain points in the offer togeher. But highlight important ones.

* In negotiation, ‘no’ means ‘not today’. It may be ‘yes’ later.
    * ‘no’ is not for ever.
* why is it ‘no’ ? can you explain me understand ?.
* Stay at the table.
    * Stay in touch
    * Stay engaged
    * Learn about them

* Good list of questions ?
    * difficult questions - prepare
    * where/why are they asking the question..
        * may be a deadline
        * what is their intent
* No ultimatums
    * don’t accept ultimatums
    * ignore ultimatums

* They are not there to get you.
    * You are not the their only concern.

* Company doesn’t negotiate.
    * Only people negotiate.
    * Negotiating with future BOSS, is different from HR.
    * Find, who in the company values your skill

* No mad rush in finding jobs

* Tell the truth

* Make the negotiating act as a way of conveying more about your strengths.
    * Use it as an oppurtunity to make them like you.
    * Make them feel that they would want to work with you.
    * with empathy, honestly

* Industry, career path are more important

* Don’t open the number early.
    * Make them like you very much first!
    * Always have numbers
    * Share other priorities
