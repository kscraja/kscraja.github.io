## Myth #1 : Only some people are creative

* subject doesnâ€™t matter

## Only some kinds of ideas are creative

* evolution - by digging - deeper - assembl
* its a different kind of creativity

## Creative diversity model

### Principles

1. Everybody is creative

* simple or complex
* evolutionary or revolutionary

2. Not all creative attribs are same.

* Different people have different ways 
* Creativity is diverse.

3. Creative diversity: 4 variables

    1. Creative level 
        - kind (dance, music, math)
    2. Creative style 
        - structured way, more detail, evolutionary
        - less structured, out-of-box, tagential
    3. Motive
        - motivated by different things
        - financial gain, good works
    4. Opportunity
        - Viewing a situation

4. There is no ideal form/combination of creativity.

## Creativity: Divergence and Convergence thinking

1.Divergent thinking: 
    * multiple ideas, paths, solutions, alternatives

2. Convergent thinking
    * choosing options from multiple options.

3. Everyone uses both divergent and convergent thinking.

4. We diverge and converge differently because of our
    creative levels and styles.

## The paradox of structure

    * Structure provides a framework for exploration
    * It could be enabling
    * Or it could be disabling
    * based on point of view - creative style
    * So, structure should be extensible
