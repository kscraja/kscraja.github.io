I am a programmer since 2000. 

I like **creating** and **assembling** things, ideas, code blocks, wood blocks etc.

I am to live and experience life..not entirely sure about it. But one fine day, I will know.

#### the blog..

I need a place to dump my learning and living 

I want to understand deep and retain that knowledge for a longer period.

#### the philosophy

Putting in words, a half-cooked idea is very difficult. 

A written word comes out only after good understanding of the subject.

I believe, this to be true. 


#### the plan

I am forcing myself to write about whatever bits and pieces that I come across.

I am practicing it as a tool to enhance my understanding and learning.
