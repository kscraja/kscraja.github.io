I am a programmer since 2000. 

I like assembling things, ideas, code blocks, wood blocks etc.

I am to live and experience life..not entirely sure about it. But one fine day, I will know.

### this blog..

I need a place to dump my living and life.

I understand better when I have to write about it. 
Though this approach is generally true, but I am making it a part of my learning model.
Putting in words, a half-cooked idea is very difficult. Hence the attack plan to clarify myself.
